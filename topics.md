## Proposed Topic

* Session Title: Driving continuous improvement within teams through Andon Cords
* Preferred Timeframe: February 28
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: The andon cord is a Toyota innovation designed to empower front-line employees to recognize issues, initiate a stoppage of work, and work together as a team to quickly apply a root-cause analysis and identify a path forward. The emergency cable strung above assembly lines became a symbol of the Toyota Way, and has widely been copied throughout the auto industry and beyond.

Zack Ayers, Scrum Master at Excella, will discuss his scrum team's journey with an andon cord and how their experiment evolved over time. He'll also talk about how empowering a team (instead of telling a team what to do) can help nurture a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.
