* Session Title: Token-based security for web applications using OAuth2 and OpenID Connect
* Preferred Timeframe:
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: The token has become a popular pattern for securing web applications. Developers love its conceptual simplicity, and architects appreciate the ability to design applications with nicely decoupled security roles. However, pitfalls lurk in the ease of this token-based security. Within the last decade, two security standards have taken center stage to provide guidance and support for the implementation of robust security infrastructure. These standards are OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect.

In this presentation, Vladimir Bychkov will cover the basics of these security protocols, explain and demo the authorization flows for different types of applications and provide tips for implementation of centralized authorization service using ASP.NET Core.
